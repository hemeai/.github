Hemeai [[Heme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme) + AI] is a techbio company focused on protein design and engineering. There is no foundational model that can directly lead to the development of therapeutics. We are focused on utilizing the advances in the foundational model to create protein-based therapeutics.

Our Focus Area:
* Create a binder protein that neutralizes the diverse class of snake venom 
* Create enzymes based on snake & mammalian venoms
* Target cancer using mini-protein-based therapeutics 
* Work on improving the application of the foundation model to solve specific problems
